# LEGO Investment Analysis Project

This project analyzes LEGO sets to help investors identify high-value sets and predict resale prices. Using data from Brickset, Rebrickable, and Brickowl, we explore market trends, cluster sets based on features, and apply machine learning models to estimate potential returns.
